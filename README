What is this
------------
This is a thin C++ wrapper around Cocoa.
Primary goal is providing these;

-	Native and fast integration of Cocoa features into C++.
-	More and better error detection (runtime assertion, type-check)
-	More robust and structured program by using C++. (less dynamics)
-	No actual performance loss. (direct pointer wrapping)

C++ provides namespace and read-only program structure when compared to
Objective-C. These are attributes of each langauges, but I prefer C++ style,
and it's far easier to make a program in C++.
