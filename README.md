What is this
------------
This is a thin C++ wrapper around Cocoa.
Primary goal is providing these;

-	Namespace, inline member definition, and private members.
-	Native and fast integration of Cocoa features into C++.
-	More and better error detection (runtime assertion, type-check)
-	More robust and structured program by using C++. (less dynamics, better abstraction)
-	In most cases, no actual extra performance/memory loss. (essentially just a wrapped pointer)
	But extra cost for event handling structure.

It's far easier to design and maintain a correct program in C++.
