DESIGN PRINCIPALS
=================








-	For convenience. Not for performance.

	This library is designed to provide better and earlier error check and organization.
	Not for performance. 
	
	Major reason of this library is avoiding mistakes. Objective-C is too much mistake-prone
	language, and overriding a method by mistake is too easy, and there's no warning.
	As a result, managing those feature overriding are very hard.
	
	Also, encapsulation is hard in Objective-C. There's no private method, and all the classes
	are always public. No namespace. It's hard to structure complex program in hierarchical way.
	C++ can provide better way of program structuring.










-	All wrapper classes are just thin wrappers around Objective-C object pointers.
	Conceptually, a class is something like this;
	
		typedef		NSView*		View;
		
	or something like this;
	
		class
		View
		{
			NSView*			_raw_ptr{nullptr};
		};


	Then, copy is bare pointer copy, not a semantic deep copy. If you want to perform semantic copy,
	then you have to call `copy` method just like an Objective-C object.

	Unlike Objective-C classes, copying feature is not provided by default. Only appropriate classes
	will provide semantic copy method.
	
	Semantic equality is also same. Equality comparison operator just performs pointer equality check.
	And you need to call explicit equals method to perform semantic equality.








-	Classes wrapping `CFType` objects are also just a pointer wrapper.
	Conceptually, a `CFType` wrappers are something like this;

		typedef		CGColorRef		Color;


	Or;

		class
		Color
		{
			CGColorRef		_raw_ptr{nullptr};
		};

	`CFType` object wrappers performs automatic reference-counting. (yes, it works exactly like how
	Objective-C ARC works!)





-	Type Checks.
	`CFType` based classes are checked by imported CoreFoundation C symbols.
	Objective-C classes are not checked when creating (yet), but will be checked
	when calling any method. This is mainly to avoid importing Objective-C symbols.
	I hope to add type-checks when creating object instances.













-	No toll-free bridging by default.
	Cocoa supports toll-free bridging between some CF types and some Cocoa classes.
	It seems possible to support toll-free bridging, but there're bunch of stuffs to care about to support
	the feature. So currently, I don't support it.



-	Direct constructors are allowed only on final classes.
	Constructor may cause hard-to-find bugs. Do not use them on intermediate classes.
	On intermediate classes, always use factory method.
	The best way is not instantiating intermediate classes.



-	No bi-directional roundtripping.
	If you created a Cocoa object using this library, the object is fully roundtrippable between C++ and Objective-C.
	Otherwise, some object will not be converted into corresponding C++ class.
	Because some classes are created in subclassed form for event handling and etc.. 
	If you're not sure, just remember these rules.
	
	-	Cast an Objective-C object into C++ class only if the object was created by C++ class.
	-	Do not cast Objective-C object into C++ class if it was not created by C++ class.




-	No reflection.
	Though it is possible to expose Objective-C reflection facility into C++, but there's no C++ counterpart.
	I just decided not to expose reflection stuff.







-	Every pointer wrappers passed by value-copy.

	Definition of function parameter type doesn't need to be known then compiling. 
	Forward declaration is enough. Every Objective-C pointer wrappers will be passed by value-copy.
	
	As a result, inline object creation will become impossible â€” yes, that is not a goal of this library.
	Goal of this library is providing consistent and simple API. Objective-C object will never be passed
	as reference. Anyway, if there's a corresponding C++ type, it may can be passed as a `const&` to allow 
	inline object creation.

	For example, there can be this sort of overloadings.

		auto	test1(String) -> void;
		auto	test1(std::string const&) -> void;

	But these are not allowed.
	
		auto	test1(String const&) -> void;
		auto	test1(String&) -> void;
		auto	test1(String&&) -> void;

	Anyway pointing is allowed, and it represents weak reference.
	Pointer passing is usually used for delegate.

		auto	setDelegate(Delegate*) -> void;




	
	
	
	
	









Keep it simple by decomposing each features
-------------------------------------------



-	Base classes are not exposed directly by default.
	
	To keep simplicity, all base class functionalities will not be exposed directly.
	Instead, classes may have `as~` series method to provide access to base class features.
	Where appropriate, some base class features may be exposed directly. This is fully case-by-case, 
	and hiding is the default choice.



-	No direct overriding.

	Cocoa uses observer pattern primarily rather then overriding, and
	usually overriding is wrong pattern. In most cases we don't need method overriding.
	Anyway some ancient Cocoa classes are still using method overriding to implement observer
	pattern (which seems to be wrong), and those classes needs special treatment.

	I am currently using several different approaches to provide method overriding mechanism,
	but none of them are overriding C++ method directly. Every features will be separated into
	a separated observer class. Usually they will become a part of delegate object. I believe
	this is patching a design bugs of old Cocoa classes.

	
	
	
	
	
	
	




	
Observer Pattern Policy
-----------------------
Cocoa is relying heavily on MVC/observer pattern. It's crucial to support observer pattern easily
and correctly.

In large, Cocoa uses a few different approaches on observing message.

-	Target-action.
-	Explicit messaging. (sending message selector to an object)
-	Delegate.
-	Subclassing and overriding. (including responder)
-	Notification.

All these are relying on Objective-C dynamic messaging feature.

-	Target-action.
	Subclass the Objective-C object, add C++ lambda variable.
	Catch event by target itself, and call the lambda.
	
-	Explicit messaging.
	**NO SUPPORT** I think there's some possible trick, but too dirty.

-	Delegate.
	Make an pure virtual class (interface) which declares all delegate methods.
	Subclass `Any` class and inherits all needed interfaces.
	Delegate is set by pointer to represent no-ownership.
	
-	Subclassing and overriding.
	Make a separated class for overriden class. Install hools on all possible methods.
	Take lambda table which are mapped to each methods. (see `OverridableView` class).

-	Responder.
	Resolve just like subclassing case.
	
-	Notification.
	Use lambda.
